## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

1. **Security First:** No reentrancy, proper access control, HMAC verification
2. **Idempotency:** Must handle duplicate requests correctly
3. **Resilience:** System must recover from RPC failures
4. **Testing:** >80% coverage with meaningful tests
5. **Documentation:** Clear ADR explaining trade-offs
6. **Git Hygiene:** Incremental commits showing work progression
7. **Reproducibility:** `docker compose up` must work

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't skip tests - they're 15 points
- Don't forget to index events properly
- Don't hardcode values - use seed.json throughout
- Don't one-shot commit everything - show incremental progress
- Don't skip ADR decisions - graders want to see your thinking
- Don't forget nonce management in API
- Don't skip DLQ implementation
- Don't forget to test upgrade mechanism
